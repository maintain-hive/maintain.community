title: "London Design Festival: Debating maintenance and de-growth at the Non-Pavilion"
---

Canâ€™t make it to Liverpool on September 28th? Or just want a preview? We will be at the London Design Festival this weekend!

The [Non-Pavilion](https://www.non-pavilion.org/), in the Sackler Courtyard at the V&A, focuses on design and de-growth. How can design help to reverse over-consumption and production? Naomi Turner and Jen McArthur from the Festival of Maintenance will join Geraldine Dening from Architects for Social Housing to debate **Planet 2.0**.

**Sunday 22 September 1-2pm at the Non-Pavilion, Sackler Courtyard, V&A Museum**
