## Virtual Event Information and Overview

Please join us for a discussion about the “gig economy” and maintenance. Gig workers (shoppers, drivers, etc) sustain daily life, and as such have been recognized as “essential workers.” But this dependence on gig workers raises an important question: what steps do companies, governments, and individuals take to maintain gig workers–or, in other words, to ensure that this form of labor is sustainable? This discussion will feature two experts on gig economies in the United States and Europe.
