We were inspired by discussions at [Maker Assembly](http://makerassembly.org/), where we discussed the sustainability of making, maker communities and maker spaces, and the way that innovation and new things are championed, whereas maintenance is often less visible, less valued â€“ and yet essential. 

Read the original article about that here: [From Making to Maintaining](https://medium.com/@lbjames/from-making-to-maintaining-584ea0a9fe08).
