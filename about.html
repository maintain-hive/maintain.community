            <p>Maintain is a community of people interested in maintaining different parts of our world, recognizing the often hidden work done in repair, custodianship, stewardship, tending and caring for the things that matter.</p>

            <p>We are a non-profit, volunteer-run community, and our festivals are funded by sponsors, including <a href="https://makerassembly.org/">Maker Assembly</a>. Our events have been produced by Newton Halewood Ltd.</p>
